This application allows the prediction of AMR phenotypes for assembled genomes of a wide range of species. It will be included in the KBase platform shortly (https://kbase.us/)

Predictions are based on the models of two learning algorithms Set Covering Machines and Classification Trees (see [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/09/388348)), which are available [here](./data/models).
